## What is reproducible research?

1. What did I do?
2. Why did I do it?
3. How did I set up everything at the time of the analysis?
4. When did I make changes, and what were they?
5. Who needs to access it, and how can I get it to them?

## Two bad practices

![Don't get Jenny mad](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQugFIWUEAErq0D.jpg)

![This will make her mad too](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQugFMjV4AAZtB-.jpg)

#### Why are these practces sub-optimal?

Solutions!

1. If you don't know or follow Jenny Bryan check her out: https://twitter.com/JennyBryan
1. Projects
    1. Show how to set up and use Projects
2. Using `save.image` to save output: `save.image("~/development/reproducible-research/bad.RData")`
    1. Use saveRDS() readRDS() instead TODO: insert example here

```{r here, echo=TRUE}
here::here()
here::dr_here()
```

## File and Directory management


## Data

### Disable auto save and restore workspace!

All of your objects in the Global Environment

1. Tools
2. Global Options
3. ![Set 'Save workspace ro .RData on exit:' to 'Never' <br> Uncheck 'Restore .RData into workspace at startup'](figures/rdata.PNG)

4. Be brave! Pressing ctrl+shift+f10 should not be scary. It's a sign that you have set up your work for RR and you can be confident in your reproducible workflow.

This is not recommended!
```{r data}
x <- 1
y <- 2
save.image()
```

Why?
```{r}
x <- list("important information is stored here", "it's going to be overwritten!!!")
x
load(".RData")
x
y
```

This is better
```{r data_better}
x <- 1
y <- 2
saveRDS(x, "data/x.rds")
saveRDS(y, "data/y.rds")
x <- readRDS("data/x.rds")
y <- readRDS("data/y.rds")
x
y
```

#### This is best
```{r data_best}
data_path <- "data"

saveRDS(x, file.path(data_path, "x.rds"))
saveRDS(y, file.path(data_path, "y.rds"))

x <- readRDS(file.path(data_path, "x.rds"))
y <- readRDS(file.path(data_path, "y.rds"))
x
y
```
#### Why?

1. `file.path` is OS agnostic

    ...works on Windows, Linux, Mac :)

    This is nice for portability.
    
2. What if you add different data in another folder called `data2`?
    
    It's way too easy to miss manually typing or copy/replace
    
    Code so that when you make a change it's gets propragated automatically!

```{r eval=FALSE}
saveRDS(x, "data2/x.rds")
saveRDS(y, "data2/y.rds")
x <- readRDS("data/x.rds")
y <- readRDS("data2/y.rds")
```

## Session information and Package Management

We have all been there. You want to rerun an analysis from 3 years ago and something bad happens. Bad varies from getting unspecified errors to debug to the worst case where code runs but you get a vastly different answer.

### Session Information

There is an easy way to see what versions of base R and installed packages are loaded into your current session.
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

```{r}
output_dir <- "output"
session_fname <- "sessionInfo.txt"
session_key <- file.path(output_dir, session_fname)
writeLines(capture.output(sessionInfo()), session_key)
```

#### Install a specific version of a package

```{r}
install.packages()
```

### Package Management

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
